    <title>Roman Numerals</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            You have undoubtedly already encountered Roman numerals in your academic and everyday life.
            We use them in outlines, and sometimes for other lists.
            They often appear on clock faces, especially those integrated into public building facades and clock towers.
            The early pages of a book (before the table of contents) are typically numbered with <em>lowercase</em> Roman numerals.
            But all these places where we encounter Roman numerals have a common limitation: the numbers used rarely reach as high as twenty.
            You are probably familiar with the Roman numeral representations for some or all of the numbers from one to ten, and you may even know how to represent a few numbers beyond that.
            You are less likely to recognize, for example, that MDCCXLVI is the Roman numeral representation of 1746.

        <title>Symbols Used for Roman Numerals</title>

        <p>
            Let's begin our in-depth discussion of Roman numerals with the symbols they use, which are all uppercase letters from the Latin alphabet.
            The example at the end of the previous paragraph (MDCCXLVI) includes all seven symbols used in the Roman numeral system.
            Their values are given in <xref ref="table-Roman-Symb"/> below.

        <p>
            The Roman numeral system is primarily an <term>additive</term> system, which means that the number represented by a group of Roman numerals is the sum of the values of the individual symbols. 
            (There is a small exception to this additive rule, which is explained in <xref ref="subsec-Roman-Rules"/> below.)
